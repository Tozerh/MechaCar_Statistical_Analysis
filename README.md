## Linear Regression to Predict MPG NOT DONE NOT DONE

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils DONE DONE DONE 

For all manufacturing lots in total (i.e., the mean of the variance of all suspension coils' PSI), current manufacturing data does meet the design specification of coils' variance not exceeding 100 pounds per square inch:

That said, there is a clear issue with Lot 3 that will need be investigated. The table here shows that the coils from Lot 3 have a variance value well above 100 PSI:

Given how little variance we see in Lot 1 and Lot 2, the variance in Lot 3 seems anomalous and the manufacturing techniques and machinery used for Lot 3 should be investigated as soon as possible.
